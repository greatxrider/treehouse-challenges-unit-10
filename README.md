## Overview

Unit 10 focuses on building a full-stack JavaScript application by integrating React on the client side with a REST API on the server side. This unit synthesizes key skills from previous lessons to create a robust, real-world application. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how to develop a dynamic, user-friendly front-end interface that interacts with a back-end API, managing data and user authentication seamlessly.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this unit, I aimed to:

- Develop a full-stack JavaScript application using React and a REST API.
- Implement secure user authentication, enabling users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts.
- Perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on course data managed by a REST API.
- Utilize the React Context API for efficient state management.
- Apply algorithms and data structures to optimize application performance.
- Understand best practices for building and deploying a full-stack application.

## Activities Overview

Unit 10 is structured around six core activities designed to build and reinforce full-stack development skills:

1. **GitHub Basics**  
   A comprehensive module on effectively using GitHub for version control, collaboration, and project management. This activity lays the groundwork for managing and deploying code throughout the project.

2. **Learn Algorithms and Data Structures**  
   An in-depth exploration of fundamental algorithms and data structures, crucial for developing efficient and scalable applications.

3. **React Context API Workshop**  
   A workshop focused on mastering the React Context API, which enables state management across the entire application, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand.

4. **React Authentication Course**  
   This course covers how to implement secure authentication in React applications, including the use of JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user sessions, password hashing, and secure storage practices.

5. **Full Stack App with React and a REST API Project**  
   A capstone project that brings together all the skills learned throughout the unit. The project involves building a full-stack app that connects a React front end with a REST API back end, featuring complete user authentication and CRUD functionalities.

6. **Course Completion**  
   A final assessment that tests the skills acquired throughout the unit, ensuring readiness to build and deploy full-stack applications in real-world scenarios.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this unit, it is recommended to have a solid understanding of the following:

- Basic JavaScript (ES6+) syntax and principles.
- Core React concepts, including components, props, state, and hooks.
- REST API fundamentals and HTTP methods.
- Version control using Git and GitHub.

## Modules Covered

This unit comprises several modules, each designed to build proficiency in different aspects of full-stack development:

- **GitHub Basics:** Mastering the essentials of GitHub for project collaboration and code management.
- **Algorithms and Data Structures:** Understanding and implementing data structures and algorithms to enhance application performance.
- **React Context API:** Using the Context API for state management in React apps.
- **React Authentication:** Learning to build secure authentication systems within React applications.
